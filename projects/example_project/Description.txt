Model for classifying 'dog' pixels trained with royalty free images of dogs from pixabay.com (images used for training in 'input' directory).
The model was hastily put together as an example so performance isn't representative of what QuickAnnotator is capable of.
Trained using cuda11 using RTX 3000 series GPU.
